# SentinementAnalysisClassProject
This is a sentiment anaylsis project i completed from my machine learning class. Its intent is to determine if a yelp review is positive or negative based on a trained logistic regression model.
Step 1: import data from csv file, split into training data and testing data
Step 2: Clean the all the data: clean text and tokenize text
Step 3: Transform data into TD-IDF matrix to weight features and for input into model
Step 4: Train the logistic model on the training TD-IDF data
Step 5: Use model to predict the sentiment of the testing data 
Step 6: Calculate the accuracty of the model
